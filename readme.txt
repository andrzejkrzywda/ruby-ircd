This code is based on ruby-ircd project from 
http://code.google.com/p/ruby-ircd/

Many thanks to its authors: blufox, emario.

The ircd.rb is an irc server written in ruby.
and ircclient.rb is an irc client. The code 
is pretty self explanatory and both files are
executable.

The ircclient can also work as an integrated
service on ircd.rb. The serviceclient in ircd.rb
is an example for doing this.
